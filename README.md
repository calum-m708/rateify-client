# Project 3 - 'Rateify'

Rateify is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) application based around the idea of users reviewing and discovering music. Users can browse through the albums and singles added by other users, or add their own. I made this as my third project for General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive course, as part of a group with **[JT Black](https://github.com/JT-Black/)** and **[Omar Al-Saena](https://github.com/omaralsanea)**. This project was my introduction to building an API.

**Duration** - 7 days

## Technologies Used

**Front End** - HTML, CSS, React.js, Bulma, SASS

**Back End** - Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose

**Development** - Excalidraw, Git, GitHub, Postman, NPM, Netlify, Heroku, Trello

## The Brief

- Build a full-stack application by making a back-end and a front-end.
- Use an Express API to serve your data from a Mongo database.
- Consume your API with a separate front-end built with React. 
- Be a complete product with multiple relationships and CRUD functionality.
- Be deployed online so itâ€™s publicly accessible.

## Development Process

After deciding on a concept we were all interested in, we started by planning out the app in Excalidraw.

After this, we put together a rough to-do list in Trello, with certain tasks marked as 'stretch goals', meaning tasks we didn't consider essential for our MVP (Minimum Viable Product).

We mostly worked together using the VSCode extension Live Share. When splitting up to do work individually, we would make git branches and merge them together once the work was complete.
